# Multi-Group Management Features

## ✨ What's New

### Group Selector (Sidebar)
Located at the top of the sidebar, the group selector shows:
- **Current Group Name** with member count

- **Dropdown Menu** to switch between groups
- **Create New Group** button (➕)
- **Delete Group** option for inactive groups

### How It Works

2. Enter group details:
   - Group name
   - Member names and budgets

2. Choose from your list of groups
3. All data switches instantly:
